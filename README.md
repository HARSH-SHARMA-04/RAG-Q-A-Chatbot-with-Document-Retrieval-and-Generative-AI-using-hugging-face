# RAG-Q-A-Chatbot-with-Document-Retrieval-and-Generative-AI-using-hugging-face
This repo implements a RAG Q&amp;A chatbot using document retrieval and generative AI. It retrieves relevant documents from a loan dataset and generates responses using Falcon-RW-1B hosted on Hugging Face. It uses Sentence-Transformers and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and context-aware answer generation.
